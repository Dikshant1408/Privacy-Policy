This data never leaves your device unless you uninstall the app or clear app storage.

b) AI Interaction Data (When Online)

If you use AI-powered features (such as dynamically generated puzzles):

Puzzle prompts

Player answers

These are sent temporarily to the AI provider (Google Gemini API) solely for gameplay content generation.

Axryde Studio does not store this information on any server.
